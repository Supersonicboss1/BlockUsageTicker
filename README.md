# Block Usage Ticker

A minecraft mod (for 1.18.2 right now), which shows how many of the item in your main hand you have in your inventory, next to your hotbar.

It only shows if the item in your hotbar is not the only stack of that item in your inventory. Created with Architectury, so should work for Fabric and Forge 1.18.2, and possibly newer.
